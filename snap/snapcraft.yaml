  summary: Determine what the license plate says about vehicles' origins
  description: |
    The numbers and letters on various license plates aren't arbitrary.
    They provide information regarding the vehicle's origins, often
    where the license plate was issued. PlateCodes lets you regex-search
    for this information to determine things like what province a vehicle
    is from or what embassy it's from.
