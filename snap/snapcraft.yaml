summary: Determine what the license plate says about vehicles' origins
description: |
  The numbers and letters on various license plates aren't arbitrary.
  They provide information regarding the vehicle's origins, often
  where the license plate was issued. PlateCodes lets you regex-search
  for this information to determine things like what province a vehicle
  is from or what embassy it's from.
